# Company outline
NAKATA entered the cold roll forming industry in 1959 and developed many new technologies. We are particularly proud of FFX Mill, the only kind in the industry that introduced the complete common-use rolls combined with the NC system supported by our proprietary FEM technology. Our mills promise the top quality performance and production of high grade tubes. Everyday we work hard to invent new technologies and to maintain trust from our customers.
